# React Food Recipe Application

In this project, I built a ReactJS application that fetches food recipes from the spoonacular API(https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

The fron-end is built with simple ReactJS components. We are fetching the data from the API and we can search the food too in the search bar.

Please download or clone the app to view the code.
